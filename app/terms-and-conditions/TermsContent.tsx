            <p>
                As a THOR SIGNALS user, you warrant that the information you provide us is truthful and accurate, and that you are not impersonating another person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any password you may use to access your THOR SIGNALS user account, and you agree not to transfer your password or username or lend or otherwise transfer your use of or access to your user account, to any third party. So called "agency accounts," or accounts in which you host funnels for third parties, are prohibited. Should your usage data indicate, in THOR SIGNALS's sole and exclusive discretion, that you are operating an agency account, you will be subject to cancellation of your THOR SIGNALS user account or enhanced pricing for your THOR SIGNALS user account, at THOR SIGNALS's sole and exclusive discretion. You are fully responsible for all transactions with, and information conveyed to, THOR SIGNALS under your user account. You agree to immediately notify THOR SIGNALS of any unauthorized use of your password or user-name or any other breach of security related to your user account.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-white mt-8">SECTION 5 – ORDER PLACEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE</h3>
            <p>
                If you order a service or product, payment must be received by us before your order is accepted. We may require additional information regarding your order if any required information was missing or inaccurate and may cancel or limit an order any time after it has been placed. Your electronic order confirmation, or any form of confirmation, does not signify our acceptance of your order. You must contact us immediately at info@THORSignals.com in order to modify or cancel your pending order. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to amend your order in accordance with your instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
                All items are subject to availability. We will notify you if any item is not available, the expected availability date, and may offer you an alternative product or service. If the availability of any product or service is delayed and you do not wish to substitute the product or service, upon your request, we will cancel your order and if previously charged, your payment card will be fully refunded for that specific order. We reserve the right to limit the sales of our products and services to any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis at our sole and exclusive discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your purchase order of products and other services is conditioned on you re-affirming your acceptance of this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                All advertised prices are in, and all payments shall be in, U.S. Dollars.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-white mt-8">SECTION 6 – REFUNDS FOR HARD GOODS</h3>
            <p>
                If you have purchased a physical "hard good" (for example, a book or other tangible product) from THOR SIGNALS or any related brands, you have the right to receive a refund within seven (7) days of the date of your purchase, if you comply with the following conditions:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-2">
                <li>You must request a refund by email to info@thorsignals.com</li>
                <li>Unless subject to additional rights outlined in your purchase agreement, your request for a refund must be made within seven (7) days of your purchase;</li>
                <li>You must return the hard goods to THOR SIGNALS immediately, according to the shipping and other instructions you will receive by email after requesting a refund;</li>
                <li>The hard goods must be returned to THOR SIGNALS in like-new, or re-sellable condition, as determined in THOR SIGNALS's sole, reasonable discretion.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Outside of physical hard goods, there will be no refunds, as digital products and services are unretrievable after delivery. All sales are final for everything outside the definition of a "hard good". The only exception to this rule is exceptional circumstances such as delivery delays, in which we have the sole discretion to make the final decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                We strive to provide maximum value for our clients and are very transparent about this upfront, with multiple confirmations required before purchase (e.g. ticked checkboxes at checkout).
            </p>

            {/* SECTION 7 - AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT AND PAYMENT, AND CANCELLATION */}
            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-white mt-8">SECTION 7 - AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT AND PAYMENT, AND CANCELLATION</h3>
            <p>
                Your subscription (i.e. payment plan) will automatically continue for the exact time duration specified (e.g. 3 months) and the payment card that you provided at the time of enrolment online will be charged the full THOR SIGNALS monthly membership subscription rate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cancellations for time duration-specific payment plans (e.g. 3 months) aren't allowed, as the entire amount must be paid as agreed. Similar to the above, there shall be no refunds for subscriptions of digital products and services. All sales are final.
            </p>

            {/* SECTION 8 – SUBSCRIPTION TERMS AND AUTOMATIC PAYMENT */}
            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-white mt-8">SECTION 8 – SUBSCRIPTION TERMS AND AUTOMATIC PAYMENT</h3>
            <p>
                A THOR SIGNALS user is responsible for paying all sums due to THOR SIGNALS in connection with their monthly subscription (i.e. payment plan), for the exact time duration specified (e.g. 3 months), in accordance with these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first fee payable in accordance with these Terms is due when the user account is set up and payment of the monthly fee is a condition of access.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every calendar month, your account will be charged the subscription fee plus applicable tax for the following month's subscription, together with any other fees for the following month's subscription plus any accumulated charges for the past period (collectively, "Fees").
            </p>
            <p>
                Failure by the THOR SIGNALS user to use any of the services available through the service provided by THOR SIGNALS does not relieve the THOR SIGNALS user of their payment obligations under these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Potential users can pay by credit card or debit card. Payment details shall be collected by us through our secure financial data collection mechanism. You acknowledge and agree that we hold data relating to the transaction, including the last four digits and the expiration date of the card used to purchase the products or services together with details on when payment is due.
            </p>
            <p>
                You further acknowledge and agree that payments are due on a recurring basis in accordance with the payment terms for the specific service purchased (until the subscription expires after the payment plan is complete) and therefore authorize the automatic payment collection terms applicable to that specific service (e.g., on a monthly basis and for a specific amount).
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold">
                <strong>IF YOU ARE A THOR SIGNALS USER WITH A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION AND YOU HAVE PROVIDED US WITH A VALID CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD NUMBER OR AN ALTERNATE PAYMENT METHOD, EACH PAYMENT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY PROCESSED AT THE TIME OF YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT DATE (MONTHLY) AND WILL BE BILLED TO THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU PROVIDED TO US AT THE TIME OF YOUR ENROLLMENT.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                THOR SIGNALS reserves the right to immediately terminate a user's account and/or service for any unpaid (in whole or part) period of the subscription (with or without notice).
            </p>
            <p>
                Termination of service in no way relieves or excuses the user from any obligation to pay outstanding charges or expenses. In the event THOR SIGNALS starts collection processes of any type, you will be liable for all collection costs, including legal fees and expenses, as provided in Section 20 below.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to any Fees, THOR SIGNALS may also charge applicable value added or other tax.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-white mt-8">SECTION 9 – SHIPPING FEES</h3>
            <p>
                Unless otherwise stated on the Website at the time of purchase, if we ship you a physical product, we reserve the right to add applicable shipping and handling fees to your order. Unless otherwise stated, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill your order within a reasonable time after receipt of your properly completed and verified order. Accurate shipping address and phone number information is required. Although we may provide delivery or shipment timeframes or dates, such dates are good-faith estimates and are subject to change. If your order will be delayed, we will contact you at the email address you provided when placing your order. If we are unable to contact you or you would like to cancel your order, we will cancel the order and refund the full amount charged. We shall not be liable for any loss, damage, cost, or expense related to any delay in shipment or delivery caused by any third-party carrier or other delivery service not owned or controlled by us. The risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to any third-party carrier.

                Products, services, and prices are generally posted at the following URL, but are subject to change: HTTPS://WWW.THORSIGNALS/PRIVACY. THOR SIGNALS reserves the right, without notice, to discontinue products or services or modify specifications and prices on products and services without incurring any obligation to you.

            </p>
            <p>
                Price changes are effective on the first day of the month after the price change is posted. By accessing, using, subscribing, or placing an order over the Website, you authorize THOR SIGNALS to charge your account in the amount indicated for the value of the services you select, including any future price changes. If you request a downgrade in services, the downgrade (and corresponding price reduction) will become effective on the first day of the month following your requested downgrade. By your continued use of THOR SIGNALS services, and unless you terminate your subscription as provided herein, you agree that THOR SIGNALS may charge your credit card monthly for the products and services you have selected, and you consent to any price changes for such services after email notice has been provided to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                THOR SIGNALS takes reasonable steps to ensure that the prices set forth on the Website are correct, and to accurately describe and display the items available on the Website. If the correct price of our product is higher than its stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.
            </p>
            <p>
                When ordering products or services, please note that THOR SIGNALS does not warrant that product or service descriptions are accurate, complete, current, or error-free, or that packaging will match the actual product that you receive. All sales are deemed final except as provided in Section 6 of these Terms. THOR SIGNALS's descriptions of, or references to, products or services not owned by THOR SIGNALS are not intended to imply endorsement of that product or service or constitute a warranty by THOR SIGNALS.

            <p>
                THOR SIGNALS is an education and training company. We do not sell a business opportunity, "get rich quick" program or money-making system. We believe, that with education, individuals can be better prepared to make better business decisions, but we do not guarantee success in our training. We do not make earnings claims, efforts claims, or claims that our training will make you any money. All material is intellectual property and protected by copyright. Any duplication, reproduction, or distribution is strictly prohibited.

            <p>
                The Company makes no representation regarding the likelihood or probability that any actual or hypothetical investment in the training will achieve a particular outcome or perform in any predictable manner. Any historical return information in the Company presentation and materials do not represent the actual performance of any specific client's experience. Past performance is not a guarantee of future success, and returns in any period may be far above or below those of a previous period. No representation is being made that any investment will or is likely to achieve profits or losses like those achieved in the past or that significant losses will be avoided. Investing involves risk, and you could lose money. Examples and hypothetical scenarios used in the Company presentation and materials may include information compiled from third-party sources. The Company believes the third-party information comes from reliable sources but does not guarantee its accuracy.

            <h4 className="text-md font-bold text-white mt-4">Customer Satisfaction Surveys</h4>
            <p>
                To continually improve the customer experience, we survey our customers often. Nevertheless, it is difficult to track and ascertain those who implement and complete the training. Some customers attend the training for education purposes only – and do not purchase additional training – but may be included in satisfaction survey results.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Testimonials and reviews</strong> are individual experiences and personal opinions of those who have purchased education and training. Individual results will vary, and testimonials and/or reviews may not be typical. Results rely on individual effort, time, and skill of each customer, as well as unknown conditions and other factors. The Company does not track monetary results. Instead, it surveys customers concerning the value of its education, training, support, and overall satisfaction. Survey results are comprised of an average rating across all products and services within a 12-month period. Client full names may be altered for privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may be asked to complete a satisfaction survey. By completing a survey, you confirm that the information contained is an accurate representation of your experience and that you have not received any financial incentive to give positive feedback. Further, you give the Company permission to publish your aggregate feedback and comments, on your behalf, to the Company's website(s), materials, and various online review outlets. We respect your privacy and will not publish personally identifiable information.

Testimonials represent the unique experience of the participants and customers submitting the testimonial, and do not necessarily reflect the experience that you and your business may have using our services or products.

                Finally, let's summarize. Results are not typical and are not a guarantee of your success. Your results will vary depending on education, work experience, and background. Due to the sensitive nature of the training, it is difficult to track the typical results of our students, clients, and/or partners. Participation in any program could result in a loss. We cannot guarantee that you will make money or that you will be successful if you employ the company's strategies specifically or generally. Consequently, your results may significantly vary. This training may be live or recorded depending on the time you watch. We do not give investment advice, tax advice, or other professional advice.

            <p>
                We do not sell a business opportunity, "get rich quick" program, or money-making system. We believe that with education, individuals can be better prepared to make better business decisions, but we do not guarantee success in our trainings. We do not make earnings claims, efforts claims, or claims that our training will make you any money. All material is intellectual property and protected by copyright.

                Participating in any kind of business carries risk and it is possible to lose some or all your money. The training provided is general in nature, and some strategies may not be appropriate for all individuals or all situations. We make no representation regarding the likelihood or probability that any actual or hypothetical business venture will achieve a particular outcome or perform in any predictable manner. Statements and depictions are the opinions, findings, or experiences of individuals who generally have purchased education and training. Results vary, are not typical, and rely on individual effort, time, and skill, as well as unknown conditions and other factors. We do not measure earnings or financial performance. Instead, we track completed transactions and satisfaction of services by voluntary surveys. Further, many customers do not continue with the program, do not apply what they learn, or do attempt to apply what they learn but nonetheless have difficulty in making this successful for them.

                If you have a complaint, dispute, or controversy, you agree to first email us at hello@THOR Signals to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally. Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any product, service, or software, these Terms, the Privacy Policy, any affiliate agreement, or your relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be resolved by binding, confidential arbitration administered by the courts in the United Arab Emirates, and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. We agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in Sections 20 and 21 below. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in the United Arab Emirates, unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submissions. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with the Rules of the United Arab Emirates. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the United Arab Emirates' Commercial Arbitration Rules and Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale, the Privacy Policy, this arbitration provision, and any other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions of Use and Sale. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or THOR SIGNALS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the United Arab Emirates' Rules. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the United Arab Emirates, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the Rules of the United Arab Emirates, as amended. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
            </p>
            <p>
                You and THOR SIGNALS agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. You and THOR SIGNALS expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.

            <p>
                Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the 120-day informal resolution procedures described above).

If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.

            <h4 className="text-md font-bold text-white mt-4">The DMCA</h4>
            <p>
                The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") creates a standardized process for copyright holders (including software developers) to ask THOR SIGNALS to take down infringing content. You can find more information about the DMCA at the U.S. Copyright Office's official website.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. Our guides are NOT legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-md font-bold text-white mt-4">Accurate Information</h4>
            <p>
                The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your notice of infringement under penalty of perjury. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621). Submitting false information could also result in civil liability—that is, you could get sued for money damages.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-md font-bold text-white mt-4">Investigate</h4>
            <p>
                Millions of users and organizations pour their hearts and souls into the content they create using THOR SIGNALS. Filing a DMCA notice of infringement against such is a serious legal allegation that carries real consequences for real people. Because of that, we ask that you conduct a thorough investigation and consult with an attorney before submitting a takedown request to make sure that the use isn't actually permissible.
            </p>
            <p>
                A great first step before sending us a takedown notice is to try contacting the user directly.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-md font-bold text-white mt-4">No Automated Bots</h4>
            <p>
                You should have a trained professional evaluate the facts of every takedown notice you send. If you are outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit notices in bulk. These notices are often invalid and processing them results in needlessly taking down content.

                Any user affected by your takedown notice may decide to submit a counter notice. If they do, we will re-enable their content within 14 days unless you notify us that you have initiated a legal action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on THOR SIGNALS.
            </p>

            <h4 className="text-md font-bold text-white mt-4">The Determination</h4>
            <p>
                THOR SIGNALS exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury.
